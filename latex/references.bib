	abstract = {This paper proposes a new tree-based ensemble method for supervised classification and regression problems. It essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for automated segmentation of vessels in two-dimensional color images of the retina. This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al. . The results show that our method is significantly better than the two rule-based methods (p{\textless}0.01). The accuracy of our method is 0.944 versus 0.947 for a second observer.},

Its clinical utility is shown by the simultaneous noise and background suppression and vessel enhancement in maximum intensity projections and volumetric displays.},

	abstract = {This paper presents Deep Retinal Image Understanding (DRIU), a unified framework of retinal image analysis that provides both retinal vessel and optic disc segmentation. We make use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have proven revolutionary in other fields of computer vision such as object detection and image classification, and we bring their power to the study of eye fundus images. DRIU uses a base network architecture on which two set of specialized layers are trained to solve both the retinal vessel and optic disc segmentation. We present experimental validation, both qualitative and quantitative, in four public datasets for these tasks. In all of them, DRIU presents super-human performance, that is, it shows results more consistent with a gold standard than a second human annotator used as control.},

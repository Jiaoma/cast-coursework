\section{Introduction}

% What is the paper is about?

The paper chosen for this report is Deep Retinal Image Understanding (DRIU) \cite{maninis_deep_2016}. The authors used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically segment the optic disc and blood vessels in retinal fundus images. They claim that their method is faster, more robust and more accurate than the state of the art and human experts.

The motivation of the study is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of several eye diseases. However, I have chosen this article because of its similarities with my MRes project, in which I aim to use CNNs to segment brain vessels for a safer planning in the context of stereotactic surgery. Since the methods of both projects are related, I expected to learn from issues related to the software, image processing, machine learning and validation of segmentation studies.

\section{Conclusion}

% Brief summary of your study of the paper and related experiment

In this work I have studied a paper that uses deep learning for 2D vessel segmentation on retinal images. I partially reproduced the experiments applying machine learning techniques to one of the public datasets used by the authors. The aim is to apply what I have learnt to my MRes project, which is related to stereotactic surgical planning. The main aspects I learnt are related to machine learning, research reproducibility and validation.


% If you were to continue working in this area, what would be your next steps? Why?

If I were to continue working in this area, I would focus on generalising the models to different datasets and improving the reproducibility of the study.
